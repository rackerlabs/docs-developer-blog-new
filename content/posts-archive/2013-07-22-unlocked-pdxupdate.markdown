### London Unlocked update

Last week, we wrapped the second stop of Unlocked: The Hybrid Cloud in beautiful
London, and I want to give you quick recap on the event. In our best turnout so
far, we had over 100 developers, engineers and business executives join us who
were eager to learn about all things cloud. The London event was a little
different than the first in NYC. Based on feedback from NYC attendees, we split
the London Unlocked event into dual tracks: business and technical. We wanted
to test the waters and see if there was an appetite for more focused tracks, so
we decided to offer it up and see what the feedback was like.

It was a super successful event in all regards - minus the fire alarm that
caused us to evacuate for approximately 30 minutes. I'm absolutely looking
forward to returning to London for the next Unlocked event (date TBD).

If you couldn’t make it or were not in attendance, we have made all our slides
publically available on [blog.unlocked.io](http://unlocked.io). Here, you'll
find the general sessions slides, included the keynote delivered by Nigel Beighton,
vice president of technology and product for Rackspace UK; the Business Track
presented by Rackspace Open Cloud Architect Leo Packham and Rackspace Cloud
Evangelist and DevOps Engineer Jason Smith; and the Technical Track presented
Rackspace University Technical Trainer Alex Brandt and myself.

### What's next? Unlocked in PDX!

The Rackspace Unlocked team is now en route to Portland for OSCON for an event
this Tuesday. Our session, "Butter up your application," covers the Five Pillars
of Cloudiness and how they apply to your cloud application design. We also plan
to share an open source project we wrote using the principles will cover in this
tutorial. This will be a developer-focused session with lots of combing through
code and discussing the ups and downs we faced when designing this application:
code irregularities, race conditions, continuous integration and continuous
delivery, performance tradeoffs and infrastructure automation. We want to help
you plan for success the next time you sit down to design a cloud application.
As an added bonus, we’ll also open-source Margarine to the world. Margarine can
be used as a template to deploy your next cloud application on any cloud provider
of your choice!

If you'd like more information, the full abstract can be found

Join us at OSCON for “Butter up your application” on Tuesday, July 23 at 9:00 a.m.
in room E142 at the Oregon Convention Center.

### Unlocked is coming to Austin

After the Rackspace Unlocked team returns from OSCON, we'll gear up for the next
installment of Unlocked: The Hybrid Cloud. This time we’re heading to Austin.
This event takes place at the W Hotel Austin and is another run of our Business
and Technical tracks. If you have not registered yet, there is still time! Go
