Information Design and Documentation presents RPCO v13.1!

<!-- more -->

At Rackspace, our Information Design and Documentation team partners with all
Rackers and external contributors to create content for internal and external use.
We are currently engaged with the Cloud offerings, Dedicated Hosting, internal
tools/portals, the customer-facing
[How-To article collection](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/),
the [OpenStack Innovation Center](https://osic.org/),
and the third-party cloud upstream platforms that Rackspace supports, including
[Amazon Web Services](https://www.rackspace.com/managed-aws) and
[VMware](https://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/vmware).

Most recently, we worked with the Rackspace Private Cloud Powered By
OpenStack (RPCO) offering team and delivered the 13.1 release, which reflects
the upstream
[Mitaka](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/mitaka/) release
of OpenStack-Ansible.

RPCO is the Rackspace-productized version of upstream
[OpenStack-Ansible](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/).
RPCO uses OpenStack-Ansible to deploy the private cloud, and also includes several
Rackspace-specific Ansible playbooks that can assist with deploying monitoring,
logging, support-specific tooling, and database backups.

We invite you to read and use all the Rackspace content, and to
contribute enhancements or corrections to the published deliverables!  All of
our content is available in public GitHub repositories, so feel free to open an
issue or submit a pull request.  We have an on-demand mini-course on YouTube that
outlines the contribution process:
