Next week kicks off the 16th [OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/open-source-2015), an annual conference bringing together the free and open source software world, and Rackspace is a proud Silver Sponsor. Starting July 20 and running through July 24, technologists from around the globe descend on Portland, Oregon for a week of tutorials, talks, keynotes, an expo hall, and more, with Rackers taking part in all of it.

**Jarret Raim** and **Andrew Hartnett** pair up Tuesday from 9:00 to 12:30 to deliver their ["Stop building insecure systems: Cryptography 101"](http://www.oscon.com/open-source-2015/public/schedule/detail/41322) tutorial, getting developers started toward safe and smart use of cryptography. They'll be covering principals and practices of authentication, encryption, and more knowledge gained while focusing on security for Rackspace.

In the last several years, the security community observed significant changes in the means and methods used by attackers in the digital space. While non-targeted attacks continue to be a concern for all companies, a marked rise in the success of so-called Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) type attacks at large firms like Target and JP Morgan have forced all security practitioners to question our approach to securing systems.

Rackspace Managed Security’s Active Defense offer is designed to operate in this new world. As a managed service, Rackspace implements a set of tooling customized to your business, connects that tooling together with a sophisticated analytics platform and monitors the results in our 24x7x365 Security Operations Center – all provided as a Fanatical Experience for you.

Jarret and **Laurens van Houtven** continue the security focus on Wednesday from 13:40 to 14:20 with a conversation on the [Evolution of information security threats](http://www.oscon.com/open-source-2015/public/schedule/detail/45327). Laurens and Jarret will walk through the many ways attacks have changed in recent time, along with the efforts necessary to maintain a successful defense against them and what Rackspace is doing to solve the problems in this area.

While security is one of our focuses this year, we remain focused on one major point: open source is a huge part of what makes Rackspace what it is. We're built on OpenStack and we both contribute to and utilize a lot of open source software. **Van Lindberg**, leader of Rackspace's Intellectual Property program, will be speaking on Thursday from 10:40 to 11:20 about the in's and out's of the open source policy that allows us to be as involved in open source as we are. He even wants you to [steal it](http://www.oscon.com/open-source-2015/public/schedule/detail/41847)! *[Editor's note: It's not theft if you give it to them, which he's doing, but I am not a lawyer and he is.]*

Outside of the sessions, we'll be in booth #701 talking about recruiting, security, our OnMetal servers, and more. We're there to talk code all day long, so stop by and let's chat about what you're building. If you complete a survey, we'll enter you to win a GoPro camera that we're giving away each day!

We'll be there starting Tuesday at 17:00 for the opening reception, and then from open to close on Wednesday and Thursday. Make sure you stop by on Wednesday for the Booth Crawl from 17:40 to 19:00 to kick off a great evening!
