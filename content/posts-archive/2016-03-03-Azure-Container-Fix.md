In a previous [blog post](https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/run-sitecore-in-a-docker-container-on-windows-server-2016/), I described how to setup Sitecore in a Docker container.  A reader asked about pulling Docker images on an Azure docker host and why it wasn't working. Turns out, there is an open issue about this exact issue. I was doing some testing today in Azure and noticed you still cannot do a Docker pull while your host is running in Azure, so let's look at the workaround in Azure.

I am not sure why Microsoft has not fixed this yet or why there isn't a lot of information out on the internet, but I found an open issue at Docker's github [page](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/19685). It looks like an outdated Docker.exe build is deployed with the Azure image. To fix it, replace it with a newer Docker.exe build. If you run the following command, you can see the built date of November 13th instead of November 23rd.

```sh
docker version
```

Run the following PowerShell command on your Azure Docker host to download and update your Docker installation:

```sh
wget -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/Virtualization-Documentation/live/windows-server-container-tools/Update-ContainerHost/Update-ContainerHost.ps1 -OutFile Update-ContainerHost.ps1; .\Update-ContainerHost.ps1
```

If you check your Docker version now, it displays November 23rd, and **Docker Pull** commands work successfully.

I have created an Azure ARM template that uses the custom script extension. This lets you provision a Docker host without having to run the above PowerShell command, because it is done during provisioning. I have the Visual Studio solution which includes the ARM template and PowerShell script [here](https://github.com/jrudley/AzureDockerFix)

I imagine that the next release of Windows Server 2016 will have this patched, but until then, please run the preceding command to update your Docker installation and prevent the Azure issue from happening.
