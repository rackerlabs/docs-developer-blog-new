[PyCon 2015](https://us.pycon.org/2015/), the annual Python conference,
kicks off this week in Montr√©al and Rackspace will be there in full force.
Python use at Rackspace is huge, from our work on OpenStack and many other
related products, whether internal and external, so it makes perfect sense
for us to support the conference at the Diamond level.

We'll have 13 sessions given by 10 speakers throughout the conference's tutorial and talk schedule, and our very own Van Lindberg, chairman of the Python Software Foundation, will deliver the chairman's address in a keynote slot on Sunday morning.

Be sure to stop by the Rackspace booth in the expo hall, and check out
the tutorials and talks that we're giving throughout the conference!

### [Shiny, Let's Be Bad Guys: Exploiting and Mitigating the Top 10 Web App Vulnerabilities](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/304/)

* *David Stanek and Mike Pirnat*
* *Wednesday @ 9 AM (Tutorial, Room 513D, $150)*

The Internet is a dangerous place, filled with evildoers out to attack your
code for fun or profit, so it's not enough to just ship your awesome new web
app--you have to take the security of your application, your users,
and your data seriously. You'll get into the mindset of the bad guys as we
discuss, exploit, and mitigate the most common web app security flaws in a
controlled environment.

### [Flask Workshop](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/308/)

* *Miguel Grinberg*
* *Wednesday @ 9 AM (Tutorial, Room 512DH, $150)*

Flask is a web framework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good
intentions. It is considered a micro-framework, but don't get the "micro"
part fool you; Flask can do everything others can do, many times in
a simpler, leaner way. In this tutorial session we will build a web
application together. Bring your laptop and your questions!

### [A hands-on introduction to Python for beginning programmers](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/296/)

* *Dana Bauer*
* *Wednesday @ 9 AM (Tutorial, Room 513A, $150)*

Beginning programmers: welcome to PyCon! Jumpstart your Python and
programming careers with this 3-hour interactive tutorial. By the end,
you'll have hands-on exposure to many core programming concepts, be able
to write useful Python programs, and have a roadmap for continuing to
learn and practice programming in Python. This class assumes no prior
programming experience.

### [IPython & Jupyter in depth: high productivity interactive and parallel python](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/316/)

* *Kyle Kelley and Thomas Kluyver*
* *Wednesday @ 1:20 PM (Tutorial, Room 510B, $150)*

IPython and Jupyter provide tools for interactive and parallel computing
that are widely used in scientific computing, but can benefit any Python
developer. We will show how to use IPython in different ways, as:
an interactive shell, a graphical console, a network-aware VM in GUIs,
a web-based notebook with code, graphics and rich HTML, and a high-level
framework for parallel computing.

### [What to do when you need crypto](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/305/)

* *Jarret Raim and Paul Kehrer*
* *Wednesday @ 1:20 PM (Tutorial, Room 512FB, $150)*

The cryptographic world doesn't lend itself to the typical developer flow
of learning while doing. Add that to the massive amount of bad or outdated
information on the web and many developers are lost or worse, build
insecure systems. This tutorial will introduce developers to modern
cryptography with an eye towards practical scenarios around password
management, encryption and key management.

### [Introduction to game programming with Kivy](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/314/)

* *Richard Jones*
* *Thursday @ 1:20 PM (Tutorial, Room 510B, $150)*

This tutorial will walk the attendees through development of a simple game
using Kivy with time left over for some experimentation and exploration
of different types of games.

### [Hack on CloudPipe, open source distributed job runner](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/472/)

* *Kyle Kelley*
* *Thursday @ 1:30 PM (Tutorial, Room 513E, FREE!)*

Come learn how cloudpipe works, how to use it, and how to hack on it as
a contributor.

### [Distributed Systems 101](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/386/)

* *lvh*
* *Friday @ 1:40 PM (Talk, Room 517C)*

A very brief introduction to the theory and practice of distributed systems.

### [Is Your REST API RESTful?](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/355/)

* *Miguel Grinberg*
* *Friday @ 4:15 PM (Talk, Room 517C)*

Writing a fully complaint REST API is hard, so hard it is too common for APIs to violate one or more of the REST architectural principles. In this talk I will describe the six REST principles, and I will tell you what happens if you don't follow them.

### [The Ethical Consequences Of Our Collective Activities](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/370/)

* *Glyph*
* *Saturday @ 1:55 PM (Talk, Room 710B)*

As more of the world is controlled by software, software developers have
an increasing obligation to serve that world well. Yet, we don't yet have
a sense of what makes a good ethical standard. The fast pace, success,
and youth (in both historical and demographic terms) of our industry have
given us the sense that such a standard might not be required. This talk
will correct that misconception.

### [Cutting Off the Internet: Testing Applications that Use Requests](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/344/)

* *Ian Cordasco*
* *Saturday @ 1:55 (Talk, Room 511)*

A brief and opinionated view of testing applications and libraries that use
requests by a core-developer of requests. You will receive an overview of
testing with responses, vcr, httpretty, mock, and betamax.

### [A Winning Strategy with The Weakest Link: how to use weak references to make your code more robust](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/468/)

* *Jim Baker*
* *Saturday @ 5:10 PM (Talk, Room 710A)*

Working with weak references should not just be for Python wizards. Whether
you have a cache, memoizing a function, tracking objects, or various other
bookkeeping needs, you definitely do not want code leaking memory or
resources. In this talk, we will look at illuminating examples drawn from
a variety of sources on how to use weak references to prevent such bugs.

### Keynote

* *Van Lindberg*
* *Sunday @ 9:00 AM (Keynote, Main Room 517AB)*

### [Where in your RAM is "python san_diego.py"?](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/415/)

* *Ying Li*
* *Sunday @ 1:10 PM (Talk, Room 517C)*

Gumshoes, the rogue program `san_diego.py` is threatening to cause havok!
What is it doing to hide itself? What kind of things is it doing? Who might
it be communicating with? RAM is a big place - how can we even find it,
much less any of this information? Stay tuned and find out!

### [Getting to Jython 2.7 and beyond](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/351/)

* *Jim Baker*
* *Sunday @ 2:30 PM (Talk, Room 710B)*

So how did we get to Jython 2.7 anyway? And what are our future plans?
In this talk, you will get a taste of how Jython works, some new
functionality, and especially how Jython leverages both Python and Java
to provide a very compatible solution.

If you can't make any of these talk sessions, they'll be recorded and made available online shortly after the conference concludes. We'll have a second post to share them once they're all online!
