In [part 1](https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/software-defined-networks-in-the-havana-release-of-openstack.html)
of this series, we looked at creation of software defined networks (SDN) in
OpenStack and started considering at how OpenStack accomplishes this function.
Continuing on to [part 2](https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/software-defined-networks-in-the-havana-release-of-openstack-part-2.html),
we started looking at the network path of VM1 for the tenant test and how it
filters traffic to secure traffic flow into and out of the virtual machine (VM).
In this section, we continue examining the filtering process by looking at sample
packets as they proceed through these filters and may then either enter the Open
vSwitch (OVS) process or proceed on to the VM depending on the packet flow
direction.

After the last article was written, the OpenStack Icehouse release came out.
With this release there are changes in the iptables rules used to implement the
security group rules. Most notably is the elimination of all chains that used the
word nova in them. These rules were still around from the old nova security groups
and are no longer needed when using the more powerful neutron security groups.

As was pointed out in the previous discussion, packets going through the FORWARD
chain are going through the Linux bridge (if not dropped first) pass through the
chain `neutron-openvswi-sg-chain` which has an ACCEPT target at the end or
through the chain `neutron-openvswi-s67c49753-b`, which ends with a DROP target.

First, let's consider a DCHP request packet exiting VM1 and then a TCP packet on
port 22 that is directed to this VM from outside the subnet. The reader might want
to refer to the previous article in this series to see the various iptables rules
that are used in the following discussion.

DHCP request from VM1 (this is a layer 2 broadcast packet) packet header:

```
Source MAC: FA:16:3E:DC:BE:EB
Destination MAC: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
Protocol: UDP
Source Port: 68
Destination Port: 67
```

This packet exits the tap interface and goes into the Linux bridge. This packet
enters into the `FORWARD` table and match the rule `neutron-filter-top`. This
rule does not affect the packet so it continues to the rule `neutron-openvswi-FORWARD`.
Because this packet is going out of the tap interface, it matches the second rule
in this chain (the packet is going into the bridge),

```
PHYSDEV match --physdev-in tap67c49753-bf --physdev-is-bridged
```
and be directed to the chain `neutron-openvswi-sg-chain`. In this chain, it
matches the second rule which is identical to the previously matched rule and
goes to the chain `neutron-openvswi-i67c49753-b`. Be careful understanding the
physdev-out term, because this is in perspective of the packet movement through
the bridge not the device connected to the bridge.

Looking at this chain we can see that the packet matches the 1st rule in this chain:

```
udp  --  *    *    0.0.0.0/0         0.0.0.0/0          udp spt:68 dpt:67
```

which has a target of return, meaning it is returned to processing through the
`neutron-openvswi-sg-chain`. The packet then matches the last rule (rule 3) of
this chain:

```
ACCEPT     all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0
```

Because the target of this rule is `accept`, the packet is then sent on to the
Linux bridge and on to the Open vSwitch process.

Now lets look at a SSH packet coming from the outside world going to the virtual
machine: First, the key packet information:

    SSH packet from outside going to VM1, packet header:
    Source MAC: EC:F4:BB:0C:F5:8E
    Destination MAC: FA:16:3E:DC:BE:EB
    Source IP address: 58.59.122.238 (10.0.0.1)
    Destination IP address: 10.0.0.2
    Protocol: TCP
    Source Port: 30248
    Destination Port: 22

This packet travels from OVS into the Linux bridge through the iptables rules
and (if allowed on) into the tap interface connected to the VM. One note about
the source IP address, by default outside traffic is SNAT'ed at the router. This
means that any outside traffic on this network has its source address set to
that of the router (10.0.0.1), not the actual outside IP address.

This packet flows through the `FORWARD` table's the iptables rules. It enters
the tap interface coming from the Linux bridge. This packet enters into the
`FORWARD` table and match the rule neutron-filter-top. This rule does not affect
the packet, so it continues to the rule `neutron-openvswi-FORWARD`. Because this
packet is going into the tap interface (out of the bridge), it matches the first
rule in this chain:

```
PHYSDEV match --physdev-out tap67c49753-bf --physdev-is-bridged
```
and is directed to the chain neutron-openvswi-sg-chain. In this chain, it matches
the first rule which is identical to the previously matched rule and goes to the
chain `neutron-openvswi-i67c49753-b`.

Looking at chain `neutron-openvswi-i67c49753-b`, the 5th rule:

```
RETURN  tcp  --  *   *       0.0.0.0/0     0.0.0.0/0      tcp dpt:22
```

matches this packet and returns it back to the previous chain
(`neutron-openvswi-sg-chain`) because the target is `return` - the last rule in
this chain, which is:

```
Chain neutron-openvswi-sg-chain (2 references)
num  target     prot opt source               destination
3    ACCEPT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0
```

The target is `ACCEPT`, so the packet is accepted and continues on to the tap
interface and into the VM.

As we continue in this series, we will next look the Open vSwitch process and
how the network traffic is moved through to its proper destination.
