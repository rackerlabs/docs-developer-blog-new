If you are interested in contributing to [Puppet][1], the upcoming "Triage-a-Thon" will be a great chance! Puppet Labs is throwing a bug squashing party on July 13th at their headquarters in Portland. Goals for the event:

<!-- more -->

* Review all open tickets in the Puppet and Module projects
* Update and confirm that issues are still relevant
* Ensure tickets are in the right status and all the right information is present to fix the problem
* Close any invalid or no longer relevant tickets

Onsite in Portland Puppet Labs will provide bagels, a delicious lunch, snacks and space in their office for you to work. Virtually, Puppet Labs will be running an IRC channel (#puppethack). The first 200 people who help for at least two hours will be sent a special edition Puppet Triage-a-Thon 2013 t-shirt. Want to be a part of it? First, take a look at [Puppet's Bug Triage Process][2], then [register for the event][3]!
