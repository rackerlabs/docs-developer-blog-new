MongoDB Inc just released what is arguably the most important change to the MongoDB database in its short history.

MongoDB version 3.0

MongoDB 3.0 brings with it a wealth of new features, but most notably a new pluggable storage engine API. We wanted to help customers get familiar with the new storage engine and features quickly and easily.

Because of the new pluggable storage engine API, MongoDB 3.0 promises a massive leap forward in functionality, usability and features. Developers, DevOps Engineers and DBA's should start getting acquainted with MongoDB 3.0. In particular:

- [wiredTiger storage engine](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/3.0/#wiredtiger)
- [concurrency testing](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/storage/#document-level-locking)
- [Journaling, durability and crash recovery](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/storage/#journal)
- [compression](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/storage/#compression)
- General [compatibility](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/3.0-compatibility/#compatibility-changes-in-mongodb-3-0)
- [SCRAM-SHA-1 authentication compatibility](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/3.0-compatibility/#security-changes)
- [Upgrade](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/3.0-upgrade/)

Full [Release Notes](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/3.0/)

From a community standpoint, the more people using 3.0 and filing any [bug reports](https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa) the better. We wanted a quick and easy way for folks to experiment. We needed tooling. A couple attributes of the tooling we thought where really important are:

- Easy to use
- Configurable by end user(s)
- Uses Rackspace cloud (or any other IP, including localhost)
- Easily repeatable provisioning; so users can break it, tweak it, and rebuild it easy

We created an Ansible playbook that installs and configures a simple MongoDB 3.0 configuration. It takes just a few minutes to setup and is completely customizable.

### Requirements

- Ansible
- git
- CentOS/RHEL (for now)

### Installation

Installation is 4 simple steps:

- Step 1. Setup Ansible and git.
- Step 2. Clone the repo.
- Step 3. Add roles and change some config files
- Step 4. Provision some MongoDB

Complete and up-to-date installation and configuration [instructions](https://github.com/rackerlabs/ansible-mongodb/blob/master/README.md).

In a nutshell:

### Step 1: Installing Ansible and Git.

For this, you need to have git and Ansible installed. Installation is pretty easy. For most systems you simply need to:

```bash
# Centos/RHEL
# Ansible
sudo yum install ansible
# git
sudo yum install git
```

For complete installation directions, see the Ansible [install guide](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html) and the Git [install guide](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Step 2: Clone the repo

Simply clone the repo to the box where you installed Ansible:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rackerlabs/ansible-mongodb.git
```

### Step 3: Add roles, and change some config files

We need to tell Ansible to use the host(s) where we want MongoDB to be installed. We need to ensure we tell Ansible the correct configuration for our host(s), as well as set any startup parameters we want.

```bash
# edit hosts file, and change <MYIP> to the ip address of the host to provision
vi hosts.txt

# install the required roles
./mongodb_roles.sh

# alter the default config (or at least inspect it for being correct)
vi roles/ansible-roles_mongodb-install/defaults/main.yml
```

### Step 4: Provision some MongoDB

Simply launch the helper shell scripts:

```bash
cd ansible-mongodb
./setup-mongodb.sh
```

The environment is now ready to be used!
