Earlier this year, [Rackspace announced an initiative](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/how-rackspace-supports-code-for-america-fellows/)
that would encourage "Rackers" (Rackspace employees) to apply for a
[Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) fellowship. Although I didn't
realize it at the time, Rackspace was the first company to have an official
sabbatical policy that would permit employees to take a year off to serve with
Code for America, and then to return to full employment with no loss of
seniority or vesting.

Code for America has [announced their Fellows for 2014](http://codeforamerica.org/2013/10/15/2014fellowship_launch/),
along with their civic partners. Unfortunately, none of the Rackers who
applied for this prestigious appointment were selected; however, San Antonio,
the home of Rackspace, will be a civic partner for 2014.

I'm attending the [Code for America Summit](http://cfasummit.org) this week in
San Francisco. With the current fiscal fiasco in Washington, it's truly
rewarding to see one level of government that is working hard to actually
accomplish great things for people. Code for America teams have developed
applications that reduce churn among food stamp recipients, provide real-time
data on jail conditions to judges so that they can make appropriate sentencing
decisions, and aggregate data and make it openly-available for citizens to
evaluate and monitor.

Rackspace is proud to be a partner with Code for America, and we're looking
forward to working with them in the future, and, in particular, with the team
that will be working in San Antonio next year.
