This week, Rackspace embarks on a global journey across the globe called
[Unlocked: The Hybrid Cloud](http://unlocked.io).  Unlocked is a free one-day
cloud workshop sponsored and hosted by Rackspace that we’ll hold in several
major cities across the globe to help you determine which cloud environment –
public, private or hybrid cloud – is the best fit for your application.

But don't expect to get blasted with Rackspace marketing the entire day.  In
fact, you should expect the opposite.  We’re a world leader in cloud computing
and over the years we have seen thousands of cloud applications and
infrastructure designs, and we have spoken with hundreds of engineering teams.
What we have gained from that is a solid understanding of what building in the
open cloud looks like; from single-server WordPress installs to complex adaptive
applications that span clusters of cloud servers and everything in between.

### Cloud Savvy & Unlocked

The idea of Unlocked grew out of an internal program we created called Cloud
Savvy, which takes the lessons we’ve learned and applies design principles,
cloud know-how and best practices to advance the level of cloud expertise inside
our organization. The Cloud Savvy program arms us with in-depth cloud knowledge
to better help our customers design their cloud applications the right way the
first time. The feedback from the Cloud Savvy program has been off the charts -
Rackers are more confident in their cloud IQs and our customers receive a
Fanatical Experience.

As the Cloud Savvy content matured and we saw significant impact within our
customers, we realized there was a new opportunity in front of us – a new avenue
that allows us to provide a Fanatical Experience. Fanatical Experience doesn't
start after you become a customer; we want you to experience it from the
start. From consultation to deployment to growing your business -- it's about
being helpful and doing the right thing to get you on the right path to the
cloud.  It was an easy choice to share our knowledge and experience with the
world, and we hope you’ll find value in the lessons we bring to you via our Unlocked roadshow.

Unlocked's first stop is Friday, June 14 in New York City at the
[SoHo House](https://www.sohohouseny.com/) in Manhattan. Future Unlocked events
are planned for London, Portland, San Francisco, New Orleans, Chicago and Hong
Kong.

These events are for developers, engineers and technical decision makers. They
are small by design, and we want to encourage a collaborative environment and
engaging discussion.

The Rackspace team is in New York City all week for [Cloud Expo](http://www.cloudcomputingexpo.com/),
so stop by the Rackspace booth to say hello and ask us any questions you may
have about hybrid clouds. You can also play the Unlock the Cloud game for a
chance to win some sweet prizes! If you don't have a Cloud Expo pass yet and
would like to attend, Rackspace has plenty of passes, so please reach out to
us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rackspace) or leave a comment!
