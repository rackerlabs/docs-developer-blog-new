**Cloud Application Black Magic – Wayne Walls**

Traditional methods of writing applications do not completely change when you adopt cloud, but are you using cloud to its fullest potential? What are some best practices and tools that can help your move to the cloud as painless as possible? Are you maximizing the products you’re using to get the most out of every server to realize cost savings that cloud can bring? Join Rackspace Hosting Developer Advocate Wayne Walls to explore these questions and get practical answers that you can use today.

**Day 2 Keynote | An Open Cloud Discussion – John Engates**

There is a vast new movement developing at a breathtaking pace that is changing the way the world utilizes cloud computing. Specifically, open source cloud computing. Rackspace is helping lead the global discussion about the benefits of building a business on an open cloud.
Join John Engates, CTO at Rackspace, as he provides insight on the difference between an open cloud and a closed, proprietary cloud. He will also explain the hidden dangers of vendor lock in and where the open cloud is headed into the future.

**The IT Talent Shift: Preparing Your Enterprise IT Talent for the Cloud – Lisa Larson**

One of the cloud’s biggest draws is the capability to virtualize computing resources, allowing it to be consumed with the click of a mouse. But behind that simple click is an enormous infrastructure challenge that has recently been cited as a major cause for slower enterprise adoption. Enterprises can better prepare for this shift and take full advantage of future computing benefits. Between architecture design and migration planning, the road can be long, so what do you do with your talent? Come learn how you can best prepare your IT talent for this seismic shift in computing.

**Network Virtualization – Amplifying the Power of Cloud Computing – James Meredith**

When the advent of Infrastructure-as-a-Service first took hold a few years back, virtualization of the network was nothing but a pie in the sky idea. Fast-forward a few years and the race to achieve network virtualization is reaching the finish line. Attendees of this session should expect to learn how software-defined networking (SDN) will break down another barrier to entry for cloud, pros and cons and everything else in between you need to know to optimize the network in the cloud.

**Scaling in the Cloud – Brian Jawalka**

As your datacenter needs more capacity, you’re thinking about going to the cloud. What are the key considerations to help plan for the needed capacity over time? And how can the cloud best work with your existing applications? Learn how a hybrid approach can add agility, flexibility and speed-to-market for your organization. Join Rackspace’s Brian Jawalka, architect, cloud strategy, for this informative session.

**This is Your Career. This is Your Career on OpenStack. – Niki Acosta**

In a little over two years, OpenStack has shattered adoption benchmarks set by previous open source projects and gained acceptance as the future of the data center but has your career kept up with its blistering pace? Come join Niki Acosta, Product Evangelist at Rackspace to learn more about how they have already made a career out of the OpenStack movement as well as become more familiar on how to make the transition into making OpenStack your full-time job, from becoming more familiar with the code to selling on the opportunity to the C-suite and startups alike.
