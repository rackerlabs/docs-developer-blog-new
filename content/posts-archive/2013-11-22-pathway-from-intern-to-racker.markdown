**Maryam Nazari** is a software developer working on data center automation
-- also known as AutoHost and displayed proudly on their flag hung from the
ceiling of the Austin office. I interviewed her and asked her to share her
story here, asking about her journey here, what events she likes best, and
what advice she has. In her own words:

I have lived in Austin since January 2013. Previously I was attending the
University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio, and was doing an internship
at the Castle. Before college I took a year off after high school and worked
for the department of states in Afghanistan (American councils for
international education). I graduated college with  bachelor of science in
engineering management (focusing on mechanical engineering) in December of
2012. After taking two semesters of internship during my senior year, I
interviewed for full-time position with the Auto-host team, and got an offer
with the option of working from the Austin office. I had always liked visiting
Austin, so I was excited when I realized I had the option to work from here.

I learned about Rackspace through a school job fair. I was determined to work
at Rackspace after my very first visit to the Castle. I loved the culture and
the people I met, it felt like the right place for me.

I chose programming as a job because I like mathematics and programming is a
real life application of math to me. I also love programming as a job because
I really like the culture of programmers, they open source their work, share
knowledge between each other and they are constant learners. As programmer you
have to be a learner because the technology changes so often that staying on
top of things requires constant learning. Almost all programmers I know do
programming as a hobby in their free time and that speaks a lot about this
career. :)

John Smith and Sheena Gregson were the organizers for my internship group.
I had a great experience working with them. We were assigned to work on
different projects from week one, I learned a lot and had a great time.

I have really enjoyed the Hackathon event, it is a fun, productive, creative
and collaborative event.

Advice? Be a Racker! Have fun, love/enjoy your job and get to know your peers. :)
