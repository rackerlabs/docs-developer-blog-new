Earlier this year, we launched our open cloud leveraging the open source OpenStack platform. On top of this platform is a rich API that not only powers the web management interface, but also can be leveraged by custom applications. Customers can use the API to embed functionality into their own backend systems. The API provides full access to your open cloud account, including the ability to provision new server instances.

Last month, Rackspace completed development of an app for Windows 8 to manage your cloud account. The app allows users to manage multiple accounts; provision and monitor status of Cloud Servers; see and download Cloud Files; and monitor Cloud Load Balancers.

We were invited to the Build Windows conference in Redmond, Wash. to showcase our new Windows 8 App. Windows 8 is already a popular platform with over 4 million upgrade licenses sold in the first weekend of its release. The Rackspace Windows 8 app is just one example of thousands of apps already available in the Windows Marketplace. Following good design practices for Windows 8 applications, it provides users with a rich experience that enables access to the open cloud with a single click.

The Rackspace Windows 8 App is just one example of an application that can be created leveraging the robust REST APIs available for the OpenStack platform. We also have an app for iOS with Android and Windows Phone versions soon to follow. The best part about the platform is that it’s open source. If you can’t wait for the next app, or you want to integrate and customize your open cloud experience, you can start programming against our REST APIs today.
