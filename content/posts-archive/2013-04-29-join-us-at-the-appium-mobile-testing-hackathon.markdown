Here at Rackspace, we are deeply committed to furthering the software development
community. We love things like well-tested applications and vibrant open source
projects.

One of the ways we engage in promoting a strong development community is with
Hackathons. For the uninitiated, a hackathon is an event where developers get
together and work on a particular technical subject for a defined period of time —
usually with plentiful pizza and beer to grease the wheels of innovation. The
outcome might be some amazing new tool or feature, or it could just be a good
time with other like-minded people learning about the possibilities.

Next week, we’re excited to host a hackathon with our friends at [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/)
for their burgeoning mobile testing tool, Appium. Just like [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/)
has empowered developers to automate browser testing, Appium aims to implement
the Webdriver protocol for native mobile applications. At Rackspace, we’re
particularly excited about the possibility of mobile testing with a familiar,
open source DSL with a strong community already surrounding it. You can find
more information on the specifics of Appium on its site: [http://appium.io](http://appium.io/).

Come and join the festivities! Whether you’re deeply familiar with Appium,
Webdriver, and automated testing, or just looking to get a leg up on using the
tool, this is the place to be:
