[Gluecon 2013](http://www.gluecon.com/2013/) is off to a dazzling start in
Broomfeild, Colorado at the beautiful
[Omni Interlocken Resort](http://www.omnihotels.com/FindAHotel/DenverInterlocken.aspx).

Just a quick scan of the two-day conference [agenda](http://www.gluecon.com/2013/agenda/)
made it apparent that this was going to be a hands-on conference where developers
could speak their minds about APIs, tools, distributed systems, and a bunch of
other topics. There were more than 20 sessions chock full of great discussion.
The developer vibe was strong and the standard developer “uniform” of jeans and
t-shirts dominated the expo floor and sessions. <!-- more -->

Today, while sitting at lunch, I engaged in a conversation about paxos, OAuth
scopes, and eventually consistency in nosql data stores. This is going to be a
great two days.

A morning keynote by [Adrian Cockcroft](https://twitter.com/adrianco), Cloud
Architect at Netflix was one of the most informative sessions of day one. During
his talk, Cockcroft shared a lot of information about how Netflix designed its
business around DevOps; shared infrastructure information; and, last but not
least, preached the story of developer empowerment. Here are a few snippets from
Adrian's session that caught some traction on Twitter that I thought were insightful:

**How to get cloud native?**

*  Free your developers.
*  Decentralize and automate all the things.
*  Integrate devops into the business (yes, reorg is part of it).

**So we're cloud native, what has changed?**

*  Master copies are in the cloud.
*  Dynamic micro-services used.
*  Services are distributed.

**Quotes**

> "Developers are the bottleneck. Anything that slows devs down is a hurdle to agility."

> "There is no ’version‘ of Netflix, it's always changing."

**Infrastructure Tidbits**

*  Netflix uses a multi-DNS solution: Route53, Ultra, Dyn. This is to route
   around failures, the "cloud of broken streams."

*  Netflix uses multiple vendors for CDN (CloudFront is good for gigabits ->
   Akamai/Limelight terabits -> Netflix Openconnect) Opted to ship hardware CDN
   equip to ISPs; it’s easy and helps out ISPs by localizing content.

One of the large lessons from Adrian's keynote was getting your organization to
"Cloud Native" is not a trivial task. Netflix went through technical, business
and organizational changes to get where it is today, and no one should expect
it to happen overnight if you're in the midst of adopting these changes.

In the distributed systems area, many sessions focused around the fact many
people are building distributed systems today whether they know it or not. It's
becoming more commonplace to split services out and run micro-services. You can
find plenty to read on this concept on Google with a quick search for
["complex adaptive systems."](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=complex+adaptive+systems). I
feel this will be a big part of the future of cloud applications as developers
continue to work on application resiliency and stop caring about the underlying
hardware except in specialized cases.

Another hot topic has been the debugging distributed systems. Anyone who has
deployed one today knows it is orders of magnitude harder than static centralized
systems. As always, there is a tradeoff, and that's part of reason so many came
to Gluecon - to hear from the experts and see what lessons have been learned by
early adopters.

APIs also came up in nearly every session during Gluecon’s first day. The two
main themes about APIs from my perspectives are: developers are lazy, they want
to automate all the things (using third party APIs) and any code they don't have
to write is good code. This came up as the quote "services are the new processes
for app developers" was discussed. I 110 percent agree. Who wants to do non-value
added work if there’s already code out there that does what you need? Why reinvent
the wheel?

Lastly, there was a huge focus on tooling. Writing apps, maintaining apps, and
updating applications all come with a bevy of responsibilities. Most developers
and systems engineers have a full tool belt when it comes to making their job
easier. It’s the “work smarter, not harder” mentality. In the changing landscape
of cloudy applications, this means more scale across a larger footprint of
resources. The tools of yesteryear may not be able to keep up. We are in a age
where writing web scale applications is not enough and we must have tools that
scale to keep up with the new world of applications. Andy Gross (@agv0) from
Basho said it quite eloquently, “sharpen our tools and build new ones.” Great
advice for any company that is playing in the legacy application space and
looking to move into the world of cloudy distributed applications.

In review, the big takeaways from Day one at Gluecon were the continued emergence
of distributed systems; APIs are ruling the world; developers are lazy (automate
all the things); and in a world where apps are scaling, we need tools that scale
as well. I’m looking forward to what Day two brings. Check back tomorrow for a
full breakdown!
