At Rackspace, our goal is to support our customers in any way we can. To move
towards that goal, we decided to create a couple of tutorials aimed at beginning
to intermediate Ruby on Rails developers. We hope that in sharing some knowledge,
we are able to help you better achieve your own goals.

The [first tutorial](https://github.com/rackerlabs/rax_rails_tutorial) deals
with using the Rackspace Cloud API (via the fog gem) to recreate a very basic
server control panel with Ruby on Rails. We'll explore some intermediate concepts
like databaseless models, and introduce you to the basics of interacting with
Rackspace with fog. At the end, you'll have the beginnings of a custom control
panel. You should have a grasp of some of the gotchas, tradeoffs, and techniques
that can be used to help you refine your cloud infrastructure management workflow.

The [second tutorial](https://github.com/rackerlabs/rax_rails_tutorial/blob/master/server_tutorial.md)
shows you how to set a Rackspace Cloud Server up for a Ruby on Rails production
deployment. We'll walk you step by step through basic security setup, installation
of the web stack (Ruby, Rails, MySQL, Passenger/Nginx, etc), and deployment of
an app with Capistrano. There are a lot of moving parts, but once you see how
they all fit together, you'll find that administering your own servers isn't that
bad, and the knowledge will help you become a better developer even if you leave
it to someone else.

Enjoy!
