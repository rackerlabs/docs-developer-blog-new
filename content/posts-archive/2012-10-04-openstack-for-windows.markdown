First, a confession: I am a Microsoft&reg; guy, and have been for about 15 years now.

I started working on an old monochrome ICL computer back in the days of MS-DOS 6.
My first exposure to coding was when I learned how to write batch files that
would create RAM drives into which I could load my games like Kings Quest,
Double Dragon, etc. (from floppy disks) so they could load faster when I played
them.

I have always been intrigued by the momentum and the global importance of the
Open Source movement as well as the disruptive nature of cloud computing, so I
decided to blog about it! This blog series is aimed at my journey into
understanding OpenStack, the open source cloud software that can be used to
build private and public clouds.

The first problem for me is that it’s based on Linux. Herein lies my conundrum,
and also the point of me tackling this journey into understanding the basics of
how to get technically proficient at creating and running my own private cloud
on OpenStack without any basic understanding of the base OS. My aim is to write
this series to help others like myself, who have a history in Windows, to
understand the basics and to take the first step towards running their own
OpenStack-based clouds.

More to follow as I continue on my journey…
