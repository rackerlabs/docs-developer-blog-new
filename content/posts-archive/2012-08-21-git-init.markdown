Our cloud is [open](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/openstack/). We believe our
company should be too. One of our [Core Values](http://rackertalent.com/people/core-values/)
at Rackspace is full disclosure and transparency, and we want to build a
community for our developers that is open, transparent and helps them build
amazing applications on the open cloud.

Today, we have [the Official Rackspace Blog](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/),
which covers Cloud Industry Insights, Product & Development and Partner & Customer
Updates. For the latest information on all of the things that fall into these
buckets, the Rackspace Blog is the go-to place. We also have
[Racker Talent](http://rackertalent.com), the one-stop shop for insight into
Rackspace’s unique culture and career opportunities.

Today, we add a third, and incredibly important, pillar to the Rackspace
blogosphere: [The Rackspace Developer blog](https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/),
a blog that aims to deliver meaty technical content. It is all tech, all
the time: code snippets, sample code, best practices, infrastructure automation,
and technical guidance from industry experts.

When a developer or engineer builds on our platform today, they can get counsel
from our teams.  Currently serving over 190,000 customers, we have learned many
lessons and wanted to create a forum to share those lessons. It's ingrained in
our philosophy to share in order to provide a Fanatical Experience&trade;, and
now we have a space to talk to developers about designing, building, creating
architecture, and configuring applications to their full potential on our open
cloud platform.

Part of enabling developers and engineers to succeed on our
[OpenStack](http://openstack.org) platform is the understanding that it’s not
just about the platform. It's also about providing a world-class Fanatical Experience
that includes world-class products and a world-class platform experience.
Rackspace has made major strides in strengthening its product suite with
OpenStack and through the inclusion of many OpenStack projects into the Rackspace
cloud [portfolio](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public/). The next step to
enabling success is to provide you with tools to compete and innovate.

So welcome to the [Rackspace Developer Center](https://developer.rackspace.com/),
a central location where developers and engineers can find:

* A technical focused blog that highlights major wins, cool uses of our products,
  partner integration, and success stories across the platform
* Technical documentation, including APIs, and sample applications
* Best practice reference architectures built around real-world solutions

We believe all of this meets the goal of full transparency. This is the first
step of many, and it’s the birth of a full-fledged technically-focused blog. We
established the [Rackspace Developer blog](https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/)
to help developers and engineers build amazing businesses and applications and
to empower you to get the job done right.

Keep an eye on the blog for for interesting and useful posts!
